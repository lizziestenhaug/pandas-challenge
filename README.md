Background
I have given access to the data for the most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, I was asked to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

Observable Trends
1) There are a total of 576 players and of that 576, 84% are male vs 14% female. Almost 2% did not provide information on gender.
2) While males dominate the number of players, females have a higher average total purchae price at $3.20 vs the males at $3.02.
3) The age group of 20-24 year olds dominate the market with just shy of 45% lying in that range. 15-19 year olds are the 2nd highest at 18.6%
